# userscripts
A collection of small helpful userscripts

# Getting started
- To run these scripts, you need to install an userscript manager like [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/) (preferred) or [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).
- After that, click on the link of the script you want to use. The userscript manager will automatically notice that you opened an userscript and asks if you want to install it.
