# userscripts
A collection of small helpful userscripts

# Getting started
- To run these scripts you need to install a userscript manager like [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/) (preferred) or [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).
- After that, click on the link of the script you want to use. The userscript manager will automatically notice that you opened a userscript and asks if you want to install it.
